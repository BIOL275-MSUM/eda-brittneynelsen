> ### Abstract

Over the years koala populations have been decreasing, this led them to be listed as a threatened species. Due to the recent brush fires that happened in Australia in 2020, news articles have stated that koalas could be facing extinction in New South Wales Australia by the year 2050. But the questions are, how much have the koala species declined over the past five years? Is there a change of location? and what are the reasons on why the koalas left the original location. I will be using data called Rinat to help me answer these questions. I plan on using this data to show how much the population has decreased. I will also use this data locate where koala populations have occurred on a map and to see if there was a change in location due to factors affecting the koala population. I plan to use exploratory data analysis to search for my answers by visualizing, transforming, and modeling the data. My hypothesis is that there will be a change of location due to factors such as brush fires. This will help me understand why they left that location and how I can help raise awareness to slow the decline of koala populations.

> ### Introduction

Koalas are marsupials that are found in forests along the southeastern and eastern parts of Australia. This continent is know for having massive bush fires like the fires in 2020. Fires have a devastating impact of an animal population, such as koalas. This species has a declining population due to environmental and human factors. This project will help visualize the decrease or movement of different koala populations. Seeing how the koala populations have declined or moved can help determine some factors on why they are doing so.

> ### Methods

#### Data Acquisition

-   I pulled koala data from the github website that allowed me to access the iNaturalist data with R for free (Vijay Barve and Edmund Hart, 2021). I used this data to show the locations of observed koalas in the eastern portion of Australia.

#### Data Preparation

-   I used the rinat package to retrieve the koala observations

-   I did a fuzzy search for observations that would occur in Queensland Australia

-   I did a taxon search to return records of Phascolarctos cinereus, Phascolarctos cinereus victor, Phascolarctos cinereus adustus, Phascolarctos cinereus cinereus

-   I cleaned the data by filtering the data from the years after 2015

-   I mapped koala data location from 2016 to current (H. Wickman, 2016)

-   I made the maps look clean by setting an x and y limitation to show Australia rather than the whole world

> ### Results

```{r}
koala_raw <- get_inat_obs(taxon_name = "Phascolarctos cinereus",
                        quality = "research", maxresults = 10000)
koala_data <-
  koala_raw %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(datetime = as_datetime(datetime), year = year(datetime))
```

```{r fig.height=11}
filter(koala_data, year > 2015) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = longitude,
             y = latitude,
             colour = scientific_name)) +
  geom_polygon(
    data = map_data("world"),
    aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),
    fill = "grey95",
    color = "gray40",
    size = 0.1
  ) +
  geom_point(size = 0.3, alpha = 0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 2)+
  coord_fixed(
    xlim = c(110, 154),
    ylim = c(-40, -10)
  )+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "vertical")
```

> ### Discussion

The results showed that there could have been some movement or decline in the koala populations. One of the most recent bush fires happened between the end of 2019 and beginning of 2020. Comparing the 2019 and 2020 maps, there were more observations found towards the northeastern portions and inland portions of Australia. Most of the fires did happen along the coasts, this might indicate a pattern of relocation. The 2016 and 2017 maps show that most observations occurred in the south. This could indicate that koalas moved south overtime due to logging that occurs in Queensland, Australia. If the data had gone back further, it could have indicated that relocation was due to logging. Even though that it is hard to tell the difference between the maps, I do believe that koala populations moved overtime due to fires, deforestation, and other contributing factors. Knowing where they moved could indicate why they moved.
